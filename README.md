# TradiTrakr - The essential app for tradies

This app allows tradies to view and update their jobs.
Jobs have the following information associated with them:

- Unique job identifier.
- Status: one of "scheduled", "active", "invoicing", “priced” or “completed”.
- Creation date and time.
- Name and contact details of the client.
- The tradie can also make notes for each job. A job can have any number of notes associated with them.

The TradiTrakr app allows tradies to:

- Filter by jobs by status
- Sort the jobs by date
- Click on a job in the list to view the details and add/edit notes for that job
- Change the status of a job
- Delete a job
